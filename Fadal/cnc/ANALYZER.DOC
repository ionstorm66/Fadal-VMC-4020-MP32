     Overview:
     Machining at 1000 BPS (blocks per second) creates problems that are
     not encountered when DNCing at slower rates.  High feeds are achieved,
     which may violently shock the slides during axis reversals.
     The FADAL Surface Analyzer software smooths high-speed motion during
     reversals utilizing the same basic feed-forward functions of the
     M94(severe direction changes) and M94.1 (incremental direction
     changes) codes, except computing offline allows distinct advantages
     because of the computational requirements (10,000 block look-ahead)
     and the potential size of data to be processed.

     Advantages of Surface Analyzer:
     1) CAD systems generally do not address severe or incremental
     direction changes.  This results in sudden drops or rises in feeds
     that can cause banging or marks.  The Analyzer looks ahead thousands
     of moves and computes effective points at which to smooth feed
     changes.

     2) Smoothing feeds is a one-time process.  The Analyzer assumes
     this duty so that the CNC can spend time machining, not recomputing
     what it is going to machine, each time the a part is machined.
     This results in significantly faster DNC rates then conventional
     methods.

     Using the Surface Analyzer:
     The Surface Analyzer converts and performs a binary compression a
     program into a file that the can DNC at 1000 BPS.
     Simple Rules:
     1) G91.3 starts the process.
     2) G91.2 cancels (Format 2).
     3) The high-speed moves must be absolute.
     4) The block before the G91.3 must contain an absolute X, Y, and
        Z positioning move.
     5) Only high-speed moves between a G91.3 and G91.2 will be
        analyzed and processed.
     6) A & B moves are currently not allowed.

     The Analyzer displays 3 different views of the part (upper left: side
     view; upper right: front view, lower left: top view).  The part must
     be scaled to display properly.  Scale the part the first time you
     analyze it.  Scaling scans the program to check the maximum dimensions
     and far left corner position.  The values generated by scaling may be
     altered.  Scaling only affects the graphics display and does not
     change the analyzing process in any way.

     Axis reversals are called "Severe Direction Changes."  The greater the
     angle chosen, the more severe the direction change must be to be
     smoothed.
     Incremental direction changes are smoothed by "Angular Reduction."  A
     severe angle broken up over many moves will cause a reduction.

     The feedrate of the tool is controlled by the size of the high-speed
     moves; the larger the moves, the faster the feed.  For example, if the
     maximum feed is 150 IPM, the maximum move will be .0025 inches.
     (Feed = maximum move * 1000 BPS * 60 seconds).
     During incremental direction changes, the maximum move will be reduced
     .0024, .0023, .0022, etc. depending upon the total angular change and
     the distance over which this change is made.

     Where the tool is moving quickly, the color will be blue.  Where the
     tool is slowing for an incremental direction change, the color may be
     green or red.  Where the tool makes a severe direction change, the
     color will be red.

     Long moves (those moves much longer than the maximum move size) will
     be broken into moves equal to or smaller than the maximum move size.
     For example, a 1 inch Z position move will begin red, then change
     green then blue as the tool gets up to speed.  When approaching a
     severe direction change, the maximum move will reduce through green to
     red.

     Sample File: DATA.ABS
     Included with the Analyzer is the sample program, DATA.ABS.  Changing
     the parameters on this program will help you understand how to use the
     Analyzer effectively.

     Each program you analyze will have a .PAR parameter file, saving the
     parameters you last used on that program.  This allows you to optimize
     the parameters for each program, accounting for different tolerances
     and needs, without having to try to remember the settings you last
     used.
